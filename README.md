# SysOut
An Eclipse Plugin for easy generating of System.out.println(); with selected variables. 

# Install
Copy the sysout_source folder into your eclipse plugin folder and restart eclipse.
If the plugin could not be found after the restart try starting eclipse with the *-clean* flag

# Use
- Open your Java-File with the Java-Editor. 
- Click on the [SO] ToolBar Icon.
- A dialog will be shown.
- Select your variables which has to be printed out, by simple double clicking the variable names.
- After you've done with selection, click on your desired position within the Java-Editor ( I recommend an empty line!) with your mouse.
- Press the Button [Create SysOut] and the Plugin will create your System.out.println(<variables>); Command with your selected variables.
- Easy!

# Note
This Plugin was written just for fun. This was my first attempt on writing Eclipse-Plugins.
